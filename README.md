# Discord Clone

## Description
As the name of this repo suggests, this will be my best attempt at building out the web app version of Discord, backend to frontend. 
Discord is extremely vast with it's feature set, so for now I'll be focusing on some of the major and most used ones.

### Stack (for now)
- Next.js
- Supabase, PostgreSQL
- Socket.IO
- TypeScript, JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion or React-Spring or Both 
- Editing on Sublime Text

### Features Implement 
1. 

### TODO
1. Describe USER DB model on Supabase
2. Build Registration & Login UI then hook them up to backend functions talking with Supabase
3. Handle Authoration with middleware.ts logic
4. Describe FRIENDSHIP DB model on Supabase
5. Build simple friend request feature(send request, view requests, action on request) within Dashboard then hook it up to backend function talking with Supabase
